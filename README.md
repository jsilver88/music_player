# Music Player

I created an audio player using HTML CSS and JavaScript. Using the audio functionality built in vanilla JavaScript, the player acts as a fully functional audio player with previous, next, and play buttons. Along with skipping to a specific song time and playback speed.

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Audio() constructor

## Enjoy!
